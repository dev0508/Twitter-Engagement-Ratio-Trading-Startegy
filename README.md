# Twitter-Engagement-Ratio-Trading-Startegy

Iâ€™m using the Financial Modelling Prep API to fetch Twitter comments, likes, and posts for each stock. I calculate the ratio of comments to likes, rank the stocks based on this ratio, and select those with a rank above 6 for my portfolio. I then calculate the returns and compare the performance against the Nasdaq QQQ.
